Why Does My Tuning For The FTC RoadRunner Library Not Work, by Jonathan Witt et al.

There are a few problems with the roadrunner library

All logger potentially have a problem where the timestamp gets messed up and becomes either far in
the past or far in the future. This can be prevented by connecting to the control hub and
deleting/renaming the folder called Roadrunner

- Additional Notes: After you delete or rename previous 'Roadrunner' tuning data you need to restart
the bot for a new directory to get created before you can run the Lateral or Angular Ramp loggers
